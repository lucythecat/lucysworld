                    <h3>Biography</h3>
                    <div>Lucy was born sometime thirteen years ago in a place that no one knows about. In the summer of 2018 her owner gave her up for adoption. She was sent to the Phoenix Humane Society. One weekend in July the Humane Society took Lucy to a Petsmart for an adoption event that would last for two days.
                        On the last day she met two crazy people and was adopted! The new owners learned quickly that Lucy was very affectionate and very aggressive.
                    Getting attacked a few minutes after Lucy being snuggly was the norm, but eventually the owners learned how to understand Lucy's fickle temperament. She be crazy.</div>
